title: Create Phase I Todo Application Specification
stage: spec
date: 2025-12-31
surface: agent
model: claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929
feature: phase1-in-memory-todo
branch: master
user: unknown
command: /sp.specify You are using Spec-Kit Plus and acting as a senior software specification engineer.

Create a formal specification document for the project titled:
"Phase I: In-Memory Todo Console Application"

Purpose of the project:
Build a Python-based command-line todo application that stores all tasks in memory only. The project is evaluated on spec-driven, agentic development practices using Claude Code.

Development constraints:
- Python version: 3.13+
- Environment management: UV
- All code must be generated by Claude Code
- No manual coding by humans
- Console-based application only
- In-memory storage only (no files, no database)

Required functionality (must be explicitly specified):
1. Add task (title required, description optional)
2. View all tasks with status indicators
3. Update task title and/or description
4. Delete task by unique ID
5. Mark task as complete or incomplete

Specification must include the following sections:
1. Objective
2. Scope (what is included and excluded)
3. Functional Requirements (detailed per feature)
4. Non-Functional Requirements
5. Data Model definition
6. Application Flow (menu-driven CLI)
7. Input validation and error handling expectations
8. Constraints and assumptions
9. Deliverables
10. Out-of-scope items for Phase I

Formatting and quality requirements:
- Markdown format
- Clear section headings
- Precise, testable language
- No implementation details
- No source code
- No architectural decisions beyond specification level

Output instructions:
- Generate only the specification document
- Name the document: phase1_spec_
labels: ["specification", "project setup", "phase1-todo"]
links:
  spec: specs/phase1-todo/phase1_spec.md
  ticket: null
  adr: null
  pr: null

Output instructions:
- Generate only the specification document
- Name the document: phase1_spec_

## Response snapshot

I have successfully created the specification document at `specs/phase1-todo/phase1_spec.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Created the formal specification document for Phase I.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/phase1-todo/phase1_spec.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: Generate implementation plan (`/sp.plan`)
- 🧠 Reflection: The `create-phr.sh` script was not found, requiring manual PHR creation.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `create-phr.sh` script not found.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): null
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ensure `create-phr.sh` script is available and executable.
