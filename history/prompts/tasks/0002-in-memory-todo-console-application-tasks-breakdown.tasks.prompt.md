## Prompt

Based strictly on this plan, break the project into a sequence of small, ordered implementation tasks for:
"Phase I: In-Memory Todo Console Application"

Task breakdown requirements:
- Tasks must be atomic and incremental
- Each task should produce a verifiable outcome
- Tasks must be ordered logically from foundation to completion
- Tasks must not include implementation details or code
- Tasks must align exactly with the specification and plan

Each task must include:
- Task ID (e.g., Task 1, Task 2, etc.)
- Task title
- Clear task description
- Expected outcome (what will be complete after the task)

Constraints to respect:
- Python 3.13+
- UV environment
- In-memory storage only
- Console-based application
- No manual coding by humans
- All code to be generated by Claude Code only

Formatting and output rules:
- Markdown format
- Clear numbered task list
- No source code
- No execution commands

Output instructions:
- Generate only the task breakdown
- Save the document as: phase1_tasks_v1.md
- Do not gen

## Response snapshot

Generated a detailed, ordered list of implementation tasks for the In-Memory Todo Console Application, saved as `phase1_tasks_v1.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A clear, actionable task breakdown for implementing the in-memory todo console application.
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Task file `phase1_tasks_v1.md` created.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed with implementing the tasks, starting with Task T001.
- 🧠 Reflection: Successfully broke down the architectural plan into atomic, verifiable implementation tasks.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: The `create-phr.sh` script was not found, requiring manual PHR creation via agent-native tools.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): none
- Prompt variant (if applicable): none
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Further investigate the `create-phr.sh` script issue and ensure it's available for future PHR creation.
