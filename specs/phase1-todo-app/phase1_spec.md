# Feature Specification: Phase I: In-Memory Todo Console Application

**Feature Branch**: `feature/phase1-in-memory-todo`
**Created**: 2025-12-31
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a Python-based command-line todo application that stores all tasks in memory only. The project is evaluated on spec-driven, agentic development practices using Claude Code."

## 1. Objective

The primary objective is to develop a robust, console-based todo application using Python 3.13+ and UV for environment management. This initial phase focuses strictly on in-memory storage of todo tasks, adhering to Spec-Kit Plus principles for specification-driven development, with all code generated by Claude Code to ensure agentic development practices.

## 2. Scope

**In Scope:**
*   Core CRUD operations for todo tasks (Add, View, Update, Delete).
*   Marking tasks as complete or incomplete.
*   Console-based user interface.
*   In-memory data storage for tasks.
*   Input validation and basic error handling.

**Out of Scope (for Phase I):**
*   Any form of data persistence (file system, database, external services).
*   Graphical User Interface (GUI) development.
*   User authentication or authorization.
*   Advanced features like task prioritization, due dates, categories, or search.
*   Network communication or API integrations.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Add Task
*   **FR-ADD-001**: The system MUST allow users to add a new todo task with a title.
*   **FR-ADD-002**: The system SHOULD allow users to optionally provide a description for a new todo task.
*   **FR-ADD-003**: The system MUST automatically assign a unique identifier to each new task.
*   **FR-ADD-004**: The system MUST set the initial status of a new task to 'incomplete'.

### 3.2. View All Tasks
*   **FR-VIEW-001**: The system MUST display all existing todo tasks.
*   **FR-VIEW-002**: For each task, the system MUST display its unique ID, title, description (if available), and status (complete/incomplete).
*   **FR-VIEW-003**: The system SHOULD present tasks in a readable, ordered format.

### 3.3. Update Task
*   **FR-UPDATE-001**: The system MUST allow users to update the title of an existing task by its unique ID.
*   **FR-UPDATE-002**: The system MUST allow users to update the description of an existing task by its unique ID.
*   **FR-UPDATE-003**: The system MUST inform the user if a task with the provided ID does not exist.

### 3.4. Delete Task
*   **FR-DELETE-001**: The system MUST allow users to delete an existing task by its unique ID.
*   **FR-DELETE-002**: The system MUST confirm task deletion to the user.
*   **FR-DELETE-003**: The system MUST inform the user if a task with the provided ID does not exist.

### 3.5. Mark Task Status
*   **FR-MARK-001**: The system MUST allow users to mark a task as 'complete' by its unique ID.
*   **FR-MARK-002**: The system MUST allow users to mark a task as 'incomplete' by its unique ID.
*   **FR-MARK-003**: The system MUST inform the user if a task with the provided ID does not exist.

## 4. Non-Functional Requirements

*   **NFR-PERF-001**: The application MUST provide a responsive user experience in a console environment.
*   **NFR-RELI-001**: The application MUST handle invalid user inputs gracefully without crashing.
*   **NFR-USAB-001**: The command-line interface MUST be intuitive and easy to navigate for basic todo operations.
*   **NFR-MAIN-001**: The codebase MUST adhere to clean code principles and modular architecture for future extensibility.
*   **NFR-TEST-001**: All functional requirements MUST be covered by automated tests.

## 5. Data Model Definition

### Task Entity
*   **ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., integer, UUID). MANDATORY.
*   **Title**: String representing the task's primary description. MANDATORY.
*   **Description**: String providing additional details. OPTIONAL.
*   **Status**: Boolean or Enum indicating 'complete' or 'incomplete'. Default: 'incomplete'. MANDATORY.

## 6. Application Flow (Menu-Driven CLI)

The application will present a main menu to the user with options corresponding to the functional requirements (Add, View, Update, Delete, Mark Complete/Incomplete, Exit). Users will select an option by entering a number or keyword, followed by necessary arguments for the chosen action.

## 7. Input Validation and Error Handling Expectations

*   **VAL-001**: All user inputs MUST be validated for correctness (e.g., task ID must be a valid integer, title cannot be empty).
*   **VAL-002**: Invalid inputs MUST result in clear, user-friendly error messages.
*   **ERR-001**: Attempts to operate on non-existent task IDs MUST be caught and reported to the user.
*   **ERR-002**: The application MUST NOT terminate unexpectedly due to user input errors.

## 8. Constraints and Assumptions

*   **CON-001**: The development environment will use Python 3.13+ and UV for dependency management.
*   **CON-002**: All application code will be generated exclusively by Claude Code.
*   **CON-003**: Data storage is strictly in-memory; no persistence mechanisms are allowed in Phase I.
*   **ASS-001**: Users are familiar with basic command-line interaction.
*   **ASS-002**: The application will run in a standard console environment.

## 9. Deliverables

*   `phase1_spec.md`: Formal specification document (this document).
*   `phase1_plan.md`: Detailed architectural plan for implementation.
*   `phase1_tasks.md`: Granular, testable implementation tasks.
*   Source code for the console-based todo application (Python).
*   Automated test suite covering all functional requirements.
*   Prompt History Records (PHRs) for all significant AI interactions.

## 10. Out-of-Scope Items for Phase I

As defined in Section 2 (Scope), features such as data persistence, GUI, user authentication, advanced task management, network features, and external integrations are explicitly out of scope for Phase I. These may be considered for future phases.
